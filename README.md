DADO for Efficient Data Migration in Cloud Instances

#Overview

The DADO project is a robust framework designed to optimize data migration in containerized heterogeneous cloud environments. It leverages the Adaptive Dragonfly Optimization (ADrO) algorithm with a Levy flight strategy for efficient resource allocation and an Actor-Critic Neural Network (ACNN) for dynamic workload prediction. A multi-objective function evaluates migration based on energy consumption, migration time, transmission cost, and resource capacity. The system is implemented using Python and Docker, ensuring scalability, portability, and energy efficiency. Performance evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods like Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

This project was developed as a B.Tech Major Project by Ch Sricharan, Sadanand Goud, and Satyam Das at Geethanjali College of Engineering and Technology, under the guidance of S Durga Prasad.

#Features

Optimized Data Migration: Uses ADrO with Levy flight to avoid local optima and ensure efficient container-to-VM and VM-to-PM assignments.
Dynamic Workload Prediction: Employs ACNN to forecast workload patterns, enabling proactive migration decisions.
Multi-Objective Evaluation: Balances energy, cost, time, and resource capacity for cost-effective and sustainable migrations.
Containerized Deployment: Utilizes Docker for portable and scalable cloud environments.
Performance Visualization: Generates graphs using Matplotlib to analyze energy efficiency, migration time, and resource utilization.
Scalability: Handles a 50% workload increase without performance degradation.

#Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/Satyam200215/Dragonfly-Optimization.git
cd Dragonfly-Optimization



Install Dependencies: Install required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Required packages: boto3, paramiko, numpy, tensorflow (or pytorch), scipy, pandas, matplotlib.



#Configure AWS CLI: Set up AWS credentials:

aws configure
Provide your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, region, and output format.



#Set Up SSH Key:

Create an AWS EC2 key pair named my-key in the AWS Console.
Save the .pem file to the keys/ directory (e.g., keys/SSH1.pem).

Update optimize.py with the correct path to your .pem file.


Update EC2 Configuration:
Open ec2_scripts/create_ec2.py.
Update the AMI ID and security group ID to match your AWS region and account.

#Usage

Launch EC2 Instances: Create AWS EC2 instances to host containers:

python ec2_scripts/create_ec2.py

Build Docker Container: Build and export the Docker container image:
cd docker
docker build -t mycontainer:latest .
docker save -o mycontainer.tar mycontainer:latest

Deploy Containers: Deploy the Docker container to EC2 instances:
python ec2_scripts/deploy_containers.py

Run Optimization: Execute the optimization script to predict workloads, allocate resources, and evaluate performance:
python ec2_scripts/optimize.py


#Console Output:

Details of the least loaded VM and container (CPU%, Memory%, Network IO).
Best container metrics (load, cost, energy, CPU, memory, fitness score).
Summary of energy and cost conservation across VMs.


#Performance Metrics:

Energy consumption reduced by at least 20% compared to GA and PSO.
Migration optimization and workload prediction completed within 3 seconds for up to 10,000 tasks.

#Testing

The system was rigorously tested across multiple phases:
Unit Testing: Validated ADrO, ACNN, and multi-objective function using Python's unittest.
Integration Testing: Ensured seamless interaction between workload prediction, optimization, and container management.
System Testing: Verified end-to-end functionality in a simulated cloud environment using Docker.
Test Cases: Included task submission, workload prediction, resource allocation, and scalability assessment (see report for details).

#Results

Migration Efficiency: ADrO optimized resource allocation, minimizing energy consumption and migration time.
Workload Prediction: ACNN achieved high accuracy with errors below 5%.
Scalability: Handled 50% workload increase without performance degradation.
Visualization: Clear Matplotlib graphs for performance metrics, outperforming GA and PSO benchmarks.


#Future Enhancements

Develop a mobile app for on-the-go management.
Integrate advanced AI models (e.g., deep Q-networks) for improved predictions.
Add multi-level user roles for enhanced access control.
Enable real-time visualizations using Plotly or Grafana.
Implement automated alerts for resource overuse or migration failures.
